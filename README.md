## Dependencies:


- JavaFX
- Hibernate
- MySQL JDBC Driver
- MySQL

A test database is provided in database.sql 
Use api/CSVParser to auto populate the database

All other required dependencies can be found in src/lib/. I have not used any dependency manager. I tried but you know Maven. 

## A little bit about the code

- `docs`: contains documentation generated by JavaDoc
- `src/api`: contains the backend of the application. Models and corresponding code
- `src/lib`: dependencies 
- `src/sample`: contains the frontend. The JavaFx code. 

Make necessary changes to  `src/Resources/hibernate.cfg.xml` as per you MySQL credentials 

TODO:

- [ ] Use Spring to make a webapp 
- [ ] Add Google Auth
- [ ] Integrate it with Google Calendar
- [ ] Manage dependencies stuffs
